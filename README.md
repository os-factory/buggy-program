# The Buggy Program
the buggy program is a "kernel" or you could say, "program" that just prints h or whatever thing you would like it to print
it was called buggy because it couldn't clear the screen properly when testing using qemu and left a bit of text.
maybe it's just a issue in qemu itself. idk!
