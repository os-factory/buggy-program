# The Buggy Program
The Buggy Program is a "kernel" made in C.

Right now it just prints 'h' to the screen.

It was called buggy because it couldn't clear the screen properly and left a bit of text when I was testing it with QEMU.

Old disclaimer: This project uses AI code, because I (Iaosi21) couldn't get the ISR to work. 

I (komarutac) removed the AI code and fixed it using real information.

The rest of the code is made by me and the contributors.
